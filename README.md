Built a custom GAN using TensorFlow and Keras to generate photorealistic celebrity faces from the CelebA dataset. Tackled mode collapse with label smoothing, dropout, and tuned optimizers. Visual callbacks tracked progress. A fusion of technical depth and creative vision in generative AI, pushing realism and stability in GANs.
